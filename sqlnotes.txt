SQL alchemy engines and connections

The basic premise is to create an engine, asking the engine for a connection object
and executing sql statments against that connection which return records

---------------------------------
from sqlalchemy import create_engine(), Connection, text

engine = create_engine('url for database')
con = engine.connect()
con.execute('SELECT * from Users')

	or...

with engine.connect() as connection:
	result = connection.execute(text("select username from users"))

using it this way means that the connection.close() is automatically invoked at the end of the with block

----------------------------------

server / database name

create_engine("mssql+pyodbc://@localhost/MD_Unipoint_TEST?trusted_connection=yes&driver=SQL+Server+Native+Client+11.0")
